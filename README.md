# SCP_Microglia

Microglia are brain-resident immune cells that exhibit spatiotemporal heterogeneity, yet their proteomic diversity at single-cell resolution remains largely unexplored. Single-cell proteomics (SCP) enables direct protein-level profiling beyond transcriptomics. Here, we systematically refined a label-free SCP workflow and applied it to mouse microglia from hippocampus and prefrontal cortex at 2, 14 and 24 months of age, yielding one of the largest SCP dataset to date, comprising 3,184 single cells (average of 1,339 proteins/cell).
