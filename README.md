# SCP_Microglia

Microglia are brain-resident immune cells that exhibit spatiotemporal heterogeneity, yet their proteomic diversity at single-cell resolution remains largely unexplored. Single-cell proteomics (SCP) enables direct protein-level profiling beyond transcriptomics. Here, we systematically refined a label-free SCP workflow and applied it to mouse microglia from hippocampus and prefrontal cortex at 2, 14 and 24 months of age, yielding one of the largest SCP dataset to date, comprising 3,184 single cells (average of 1,339 proteins/cell). Compared to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, SCP data showed higher expression completeness and lower coefficient of variation. We identified distinct microglial subpopulations and characterized their spatiotemporal heterogeneity during aging. Notably, morphology-based analysis revealed that proteins significantly correlated with cell size were associated with their functional states. Moreover, we defined "phagoproteome" of microglia, and observed subtype-specific phagocytic preferences. This study underscores the potential of SCP and provides a valuable proteomic resource for studying microglia subpopulations during brain aging.
